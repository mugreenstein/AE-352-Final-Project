# AE352 Final Project

## Overview
This project is designed for AE352 Final Project. The project is implemented in Python and is structured to be run entirely through the provided Jupyter Notebook.

## How to Use
1. Open the `main.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook.
2. Run all the cells in the notebook sequentially.
3. The notebook will handle all computations and display the results.

## Project Structure
- `main.ipynb`: The main Jupyter Notebook that contains the code and instructions to execute the project.
- Additional files are used internally by the notebook and do not require direct interaction.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python libraries (install using `pip install -r requirements.txt`).

## Notes
- Ensure all files are in the provided structure (written in `main.ipynb`) before running the notebook.
- To change constants and initial conditions, follow instructions in cell labeled `Initial Conditions and Constants` in `main.ipynb`.
